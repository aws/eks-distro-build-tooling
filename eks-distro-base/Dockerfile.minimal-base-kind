# Using one multistage Dockerfile since we use buildkit in prow
# there is no image repo so building images that build on each other 
# is not supported, unless we do a multistage build like the following
# where the caching system can be used for subsequent target builds

# *NOTE* we have to limit our number of layers heres because in presubmits there
# is no overlay fs and we will run out of space quickly

# This build is meant to include the deps from the kind base image defined in the upstream
# dockerfile, plus the changes from the patching we do in eks-anywhere-build-tooling
# if the packages get out of date, its not the end of the world since the resulting image
# will contain yum and the eks-anwyhere build can instal additional packages as neccessary
# the intent is for the yum installs downstream are no-ops
