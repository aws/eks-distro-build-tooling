# Using one multistage Dockerfile since we use buildkit in prow
# there is no image repo so building images that build on each other 
# is not supported, unless we do a multistage build like the following
# where the caching system can be used for subsequent target builds

# *NOTE* we have to limit our number of layers heres because in presubmits there
# is no overlay fs and we will run out of space quickly
